 The main logic of this project is to create a section with 3 different component and flex them .
 initialize animation when we click it must expand and bg color of the content should be changed and the vertical writting patten should be changed to horizontal after clicking it .
 i have implemented a js file inside Data and named as content.js and mapped it to the home.jsx so that we can use its content
